ABOUT
Creating a MERN, full-stack application for a dealership. I am using NEXT JS on the frontend & created a backend API, with CRUD functionallity, using Express, as well as implemented Multer for uploading images. I have only been programming since 2020, but feel free to use this as a starter for a MERN application. Don't forget to add a dotenv file with a MongoDB.

FOR BACKEND DEVELOPMENT SERVER:
cd backend
npm run dev

FOR FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT SERVER RUN:
cd frontend
npm run dev
