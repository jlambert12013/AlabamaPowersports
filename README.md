ABOUT THIS PROJECT

MERN STACK but with Next JS instead of React.
I am creating a MERN, full-stack application for a dealership. I am using NEXT JS on the frontend & created a backend API, with CRUD functionallity, using Express, as well as implemented Multer for uploading images. I have only been programming since 2020, but feel free to use this as a starter for a MERN application. Also, any suggestion, tips & tricks are welcome. Note, don't forget to add a dotenv file with a MongoDB.


FOR BACKEND DEVELOPMENT SERVER:
## cd backend
# npm install 
# npm install -D
# npm run dev

FOR FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT SERVER RUN:
# cd frontend
# cd backend
# npm install 
# npm install -D
